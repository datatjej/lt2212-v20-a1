# LT2212 V20 Assignment 1

Part1: 
I chose to convert the words to lower case characters and to remove punctuation and numbers by the isalpha() function. 

Part4: 
The results changed in the way that function words (like "the", "a", "and") were replaced by content words such as "oil", "tonnes" and "wheat". Good stuff.
